            <p class="paragraph">The importance of on-page SEO can't be stressed enough. You can have the best backlink profile in the world, but if your page doesn't have <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/semantic-search-seo/264037/" target="_blank" class="alink">semantic intent</a>, targeting commercially viable search queries, then all those lovely links are just going to waste. <p>

            <p class="paragraph">If you're using a CMS like Wordpress or Joomla, then plugins like <a href="https://yoast.com/" class="alink">YOAST</a> and <a href="https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/sh404sef/" class="alink">sh404SEF</a> do most of the heavy lifting for you.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">But what if you're operating a smaller site without a CMS, built on pure HTML, CSS and JS (like I am with this one you are on right now), and you want to have more organised control over your SEO. Well, PHP is a great option for that. As a server side language, PHP lets replace your static <code class="code-inline">&lt;head&gt;</code> with a dynamic one, giving you organised, granular SEO control on a page-by-page basis.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Here's how I organised this site's SEO using PHP.</p>

            <h2 class="heading heading--secondary">1. Dynamic &lt;head&gt;</code></h2>
